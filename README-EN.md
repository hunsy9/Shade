### Motivation
_This project was based on my experience as an undergraduate researcher in the operating system and cloud laboratory._

The lab assigned Ubuntu servers to students for research purposes,

We shared the IP assigned to each person through **Google shared documents** and accessed them to work.

However, during the process above, we thought that sharing Private IP and 1:1 NAT Public IP through documents could be a security issue.

So, **Can't the lab manager allow the lab student to work without telling the lab student the IP?**

Based on the above idea, I thought, "Let's automate the way we share and access server access information with software!"

And this toy project started.
